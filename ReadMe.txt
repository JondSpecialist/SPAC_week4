The file Uge4_iterables does a couple of things:
 - Defines a simple yield function to read files line by line.

 - Reads the file sunshine_stats.txt containing data of hours of sunshine for cities around the
   world (found online, forgot to note source and can't find it now, good thing it's not the
   buggest project in the world).
 - Does a bit of data cleaning.
 - Returns the cities with more than N hours of sunlight (specified when calling function).
   as well as associated month by month data.

 - Writes a new file, fake_names.txt, containing names generated by the faker module.

 - Defines a function to read a txt file containing names and extract the following data:
	- number of occurences of first and last initials for all letters of the alphabet.
	- number of occurences for a given name length (max length is hard coded to 30,
	  but could be written to update dynamically as longer names are encountered.
	- a matrix containing number of occurrences of firsname-lastname initial pairings.

 - Calls functions to make 4 plots displaying the extracted Data:
	- Line plot of average monthly sunhours for cities with more than 3900 hours of sun
	  per year
	- Histogram of namelengths also containing statistical data (mean, avg, standard dev)
	- Histogram of occurrences of first and last initials
	- 3D Histogram of occurrences of first-lastname initial pairings.


Requiered Pyhon modules:
Numpy
Matplotlib
Faker

Please make sure that this map is the working directory so the code finds the Sunshine file.

Use the command '%matplotlib qt' in your terminal for actual 3D viewing of the 3d plot.
